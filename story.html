                 <p class="story-p"> Azeroth best monburger is founded months before the initial release of The Burning Crusade Expansion.<br>
                    Our forefathers were bored adventurers who already cleared every content in Vanilla Wow and didn't like the pvp grind.<br>
                    What started as a side project soon became big enough to have a presence in every major city.<br></p>
                <p class="story-p">At first our products made only local ingridients from Elwynn Forest(Our <b>Murloc</b> patty is still the most succesful item on the shop)<br>
            As our influence grow, so did the selection of choices for the burger meats!From wolf, <b>murloc</b>, bear, spider and gnoll<br>
            we arrived to the more <i>exotic choices</i> like naga,demon,satyr, various dinosaur meats,dragon etc.<br></p>
            <p class="story-p">Along the way, we had to make a few compromises, such as: Cease to use half naked females boosting our traffic(remind you we started in <b>Goldshire</b>)<br>
            Taking off <i>Gnome and Goblin</i> meat from the menus along with the Worgen<br>
            Dismantle the whole Black Market we built around importing ingridients etc<br>
            But our business survived every obstacles got in the way,and still going strong to this day<br></p>
            <p class="story-p">For the last note, we like to thank everyone involved in growing the shop to what is it today:<br>
            Our staff, our dear customers, our partners in business<br> 
            and last but not least to the millions of slauthered creature to give us their meat for the greater good.<br>
            Hope to see your around, have a fantastic time with us!
